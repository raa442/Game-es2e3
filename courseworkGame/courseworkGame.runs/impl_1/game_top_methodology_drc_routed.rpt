TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock CLK/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin CLK/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_div_reg[0]/C, clk_div_reg[10]/C, clk_div_reg[12]/C, clk_div_reg[11]/C, clk_div_reg[14]/C, clk_div_reg[17]/C, clk_div_reg[13]/C, clk_div_reg[16]/C, clk_div_reg[15]/C, clk_div_reg[3]/C, clk_div_reg[1]/C, clk_div_reg[2]/C, clk_div_reg[18]/C, clk_div_reg[19]/C, clk_div_reg[20]/C (the first 15 of 24 listed)
